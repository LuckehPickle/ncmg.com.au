I recently had the pleasure of designing and developing a website for North Coast Marble & Granite (NCMG). The website has the following features:

 * **Staff area:** With a simple yet powerful permissions system. Here staff can upload new images, review past messages from the contact us form, and alter some website settings.
 * **Landing page:** Anyone can visit, at [ncmg.com.au](https://www.ncmg.com.au).
     * **Contact form:** Users can send messages to the sales team at NCMG. It's quick, and easy.
     * **Gallery:** Staff members can add new images, add labels and more.

If you're interested, this website has a corresponding [style guide](https://github.com/LuckehPickle/ncmg-style-guide).
